It's been a decade since I last shared my thoughts here. Life moved on, new challenges emerged, and writing took a backseat. But something remarkable has changed the landscape of software development: agentic-assisted coding.

The rise of AI-powered coding assistants that can autonomously understand context, reason about problems, and generate meaningful solutions has rekindled my passion for exploring and sharing ideas.

As I witness this transformation, I felt compelled to come back and document this fascinating new landscape. There's so much to discuss: how these tools are changing the way we architect systems, the new patterns emerging in human-AI collaboration, and what this means for the future of software engineering.

## Setting Up for the Future

To dive into this new world, I've taken the first practical steps. Today, I installed VS Code—the editor that has become the standard for modern development. I linked it to GitHub to streamline my workflow, and most importantly, I installed GitHub Copilot.

This setup is more than just technical infrastructure; it's a commitment to experiencing firsthand how agentic-assisted coding is reshaping our day-to-day work. If you're curious about getting started with this setup, I found [this excellent walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmojMIywzMY) incredibly helpful.

The journey ahead promises to be enlightening. Let's see where this takes us.
