Born and raised in Barcelona, I stayed local to study Computer Science at BarcelonaTech. My professional journey began at Sadako Technologies, where I worked across software, computer vision, and machine learning. In 2021, I traded the beach for the mountains and moved to Zurich for a role at Meta.

After five wonderful years, my wife and I have decided to return to Barcelona to be with our family. I’m about to start a new position at ANYbotics; it’s a Swiss company I love, but now I get to do the work from much closer to home! :)
